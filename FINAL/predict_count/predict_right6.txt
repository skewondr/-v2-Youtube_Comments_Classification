 saw movie jasmine really good smith great aladdin meh jafar worst
index: 50, real:0, predict:0
 another thing <UKN> like <UKN> hollywood films <UKN> feminist agenda film single white main cast yet white <UKN> stupid like <UKN> king thing jasmine <UKN> 21 <UKN> feminist film complete failure
index: 51, real:0, predict:0
 cinderella good one
index: 53, real:0, predict:0
 n't watch yet pretty much 's crap movie people thought
index: 54, real:0, predict:0
 never seen original aladdin thought movie great loved songs music choreography cgi genie wasnt bad looked trailer think smith great pick role overall never seen original loved
index: 57, real:0, predict:0
 n't care fast slow <UKN> rushed others would n't end aladdin meeting jasmine rushed party scene would n't end n't care genie 's love story jasmine 's song speechless <UKN> fine <UKN> cringey it pain get 'm glad n't pay money see
index: 59, real:0, predict:0
 disagree u mr stuckmann sorry bro
index: 60, real:0, predict:0
 found live action performance <UKN> entertaining movie
index: 61, real:0, predict:0
 say aladdin live action movie dull completely bland heck acting average <UKN> effects background easy tell green screen yeah stick original
index: 62, real:0, predict:0
 loved movie things hated guy ritchie directed music numbers especially one jump <UKN> god cringey ’
index: 63, real:0, predict:0
 think 're super biased n't like actor played aladdin even though performance good
index: 64, real:0, predict:0
 thought main thing ruined movie music honestly one memorable things disney movies let 's face music <UKN> <UKN> wrote songs <UKN> one would sing musical theater reason allows characters sing emotion <UKN> 're feeling since aladdin musical allowing songs ability convey emotion audience pretty important weird try turn songs pop
index: 66, real:0, predict:0
 jafar ruined movie rest <UKN> movie quite enjoyable
index: 68, real:0, predict:0
 <UKN> ’ like movie much hope lion king good smith good tho

 n't watch reviews chris 's difference source material taking <UKN> drawn animation <UKN> <UKN> cgi snake staff part <UKN> character jasmine pet tiger aladdin abu think get ca n't remove things source material disagree reference back last jedi come 're nitpicking reason n't <UKN> source material expanded character details simple
index: 80, real:0, predict:0
 movie bad idea beginning aladdin movie character designed around genie well genie designed completely around robin williams 's known robin williams would <UKN> role whole movie would <UKN>
index: 82, real:0, predict:0
